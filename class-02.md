`Question #1`: **What is Markup?**

`Answer`: it is add tags to the contents of the page to provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the structure for the page.



`Question #2`:**What is the difference between Structural markup &Semantic markup?**

`Answer` _Structural markup_:it is the elements use to describe both **headings and paragraphs**.

_Semantic markup_: it is **extra information**,for example: quotation.

`Question #3`:**How many Headings Levels are in HTML?**

`Answer` There are six "levels" of headings:

`<h1>` for Primary Heading.

`<h2-h6>` for subheadings.

`Question #4`:**How can you create a paragraph in HTML?**

`Answer` You can create a paragraph by surrounding the words that make up the paragraph with an opening tag `<p>` and closing tag `</p>`.

`Question #5`:**What is the difference between `<b>` & `<i>`?**


`Answer`

you can make characters appear bold by using `<b>` tag. so you can use it to present a text in a visually different way.
Even more,you can make characters appear _italic_ by using `<i>` tag.


![bold & italic](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R2d85886c23d5b90762e1083ce90a7352?rik=DENx3U5bDqXdSg&riu=http%3a%2f%2fdocs.moodle.org%2f25%2fen%2fimages_en%2f6%2f6f%2fHtml_tags.png&ehk=%2bVnFuF%2fjJ3KhCTvsVFBJ%2flv09tHHJp%2bYAkHcCysYs%2b4%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)

`Question #6`:**When do you use Superscript & Subscrip?**

`Answer`

we use Superscript tag `<sup>` to make the text up, such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts.

![subscript](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4bdKrgPeYd8/hqdefault.jpg)

`Question #7`:**What is white space collapsing?**
	
  `Answer`
  
White spaces are blank sequence of space characters which treated as a single space character in html.
(if there is two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays as one space).This enables you to organize the html code into a much more readable format.

`Question #8`:**What are Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules?**

`Answer`

* Line Breaks `<br />` it is used to add a line break between paragraphs, for example:

![br](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/break-sentence-result.jpg)

* Horizontal Rules `<hr />`: t is used to add a break between themes 
![hr](https://th.bing.com/th/id/Re9ec636d976d7368ed34af2966024454?rik=rMTn%2bkgjuMtSaw&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mrinitialman.com%2fLibrary%2fHTML%2fPictures%2fHTML-Empty_and_Semantics%2fhoriz_rule.jpg&ehk=BEczC9FArS55jaDu%2ft526OXIK9oexiwErrii69Ljx84%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)
 
 `<br />` & `<hr />` are **Empty elements** because they do not have any words between an opening and closing tag / both of them have only one tag.Before the 
closing angled bracket it should  be a space and a forward slash character.

`Question #9`:**How do HTML editors views of the page you are creating?**

`Answer`they use two ways:

1. a visual editor:it is the same as word processors.

2. a code view:it shows the codes that you are created by visiual editors. you can manually edit or just enter new code.

`Question #10`:**What are Semantic Markup elements?**

`Answer`
1. * **Strong `<strong>` & Emphasis `<em>`**:
 we use `<strong>`to indicates that the content has strong importance( the text is displayed as **bold**by the browser). but we use `<em>` to emphasize certain words rather than the rest of the text (the text is displayed as _italic_).

2. * **Quotations `<blockquote>` & `<q>`**:
`<blockquote>`: we use this element to for **longer quotes** that take up an entire paragraph. on the other hand, we use `<q>` for **shorter quotes** that sit within a paragraph.

example of `<q>` tag:

3. * **Abbreviations `<abbr>` / Acronyms `<acronym>`**

*The Acronyms `<acronym>` tag was used in HTML4 to definean  Acronym*

4. * **Citations `<cite>` & Definitions `<dfn>`**:

  * we use `<cite>` tag when we want to reference a piece of work, such as a book.so the `<cite>` will tell us  where the citation is from.
  * we use `<dfn>` tag when we want to explain a new terms.

6. * **Changes to Content `<ins>`& `<del>`& `<s>`:**
   * we use `<ins>` tag to show the content that has been **inserted** into a document.

## What is CSS:

![css](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/introductiontohtmlcss-part2-120711042239-phpapp02/95/introduction-to-css-2-728.jpg?cb=1341981277)

* CSS makes web pages more attractive.
* to understand how CSS works you should imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.
* you can control the way that each individual box by creating rules>
* CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements.

### A CSS rule contains *two parts*:

    1. a selector: which element the rule applies to.
    2. a declaration: how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled.
    
   ![CSS rule](https://th.bing.com/th/id/Rc728c3e37a1da82b00611b04bfec4a1c?rik=TiLZexmADewhhQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2ffrontend.turing.io%2fassets%2fimages%2fcss-rule.png&ehk=BRpWKNpvSABYrmvNON9lXEixUusSDfBXUsP3dUXq5Zg%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)
   
   #### CSS declarations made up of two parts:  
   
     1. a property: it indicates what aspects of the element you want to change.
     2. a value :it indicates what settings you want to use for the chosen properties.
     
 ![css declaration](https://th.bing.com/th/id/Ree4cac2ce08bd8b1a5800f8aed2b1823?rik=dQGrp2pUtg1MBQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2fcscie12.dce.harvard.edu%2flecture_notes%2f2014%2f20140224%2fimages%2fcss_property_value.png&ehk=A6iaLrMIzc9O1d8SFE5eVrozlIpg2IO9UMYdtrgGmME%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)
 
 
 ### External & Internal CSS:
 
 a. External CSS`<link>` include:
 
    * href (the path to the CSS file)
    * type (the type of document being linked to)
    * rel (s the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to)
 
 ![css](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R1cfc7c32233e05bdf12bca9ba66b9b50?rik=XXtJzIxnM57oUQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2ffitbloggin.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f06%2fFitbloggin-HTML-and-CSS-for-the-Non-Technical-Blogger-9.jpg&ehk=oefvxml0JBsHIZLzliOwGwzQ6ed2lAbevoGtwGwqg6g%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)
 
 b. Internal CSS `<style>`: you put CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a `<style>` element.
 
 ![internal CSS](https://th.bing.com/th/id/Rec5850033013124817713c0f514a9bb4?rik=noCWafiXBRB7Ig&pid=ImgRaw)
 
 ### CSS Selectors:
 **CSS selector allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document**
 
 ![css selectors](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5021f37bec5845b1a1d21346c256d073)
 
 ### How Css Rules Cascade:
 
 1. *Last rule*: if you have identical selectors, the more specific rule will take precedence over anthor. 
 2. *Specificity*:  the more specific rule will take precedence over more general ones.
 
![](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R7848c180e5d0875a29e07758b5696cec?rik=3YE3wv8frsuqtQ&pid=ImgRaw)

 3. *important*: to indicate that it should be considered more important than other rules, you can add `!` important after any property value.
    
 ### CSS inheritance:
 
 * a property should inherit its value from its parent element.

### Why do we use External Style Sheets?
-there are  advantages to placing your CSS rules in a separate style sheet:
  * All of your web pages can share the same style sheet by using the `<link>`element.so there is no need to repeat same code in every page.
  * By using CSS stylesheet, the rest of the site will be loaded faster.
  * to make any changes on site appearence you only need to edit the one CSS file and all of your pages will be updated.
   
 ### CSS Versions:
