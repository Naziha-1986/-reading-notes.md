`Question #1`: **What is Markup?**

`Answer`: it is add tags to the contents of the page to provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the structure for the page.



`Question #2`:**What is the difference between Structural markup &Semantic markup?**

`Answer` _Structural markup_:it is the elements use to describe both **headings and paragraphs**.

_Semantic markup_: it is **extra information**,for example: quotation.

`Question #3`:**How many Headings Levels are in HTML?**

`Answer` There are six "levels" of headings:

`<h1>` for Primary Heading.

`<h2-h6>` for subheadings.

`Question #4`:**How can you create a paragraph in HTML?**

`Answer` You can create a paragraph by surrounding the words that make up the paragraph with an opening tag `<p>` and closing tag `</p>`.

`Question #5`:**What is the difference between `<b>` & `<i>`?**


`Answer`

you can make characters appear bold by using `<b>` tag. so you can use it to present a text in a visually different way.
Even more,you can make characters appear _italic_ by using `<i>` tag.

`Question #6`:**When do you use Superscript & Subscrip?**

`Answer`

we use Superscript tag `<sup>` to make the text up, such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts.

`Question #7`:**What is white space collapsing?**
	
  `Answer`
  
White spaces are blank sequence of space characters which treated as a single space character in html.
(if there is two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays as one space).This enables you to organize the html code into a much more readable format.

`Question #8`:**What are Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules?**

`Answer`

* Line Breaks `<br />` it is used to add a line break between paragraphs, for example:

![br](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/break-sentence-result.jpg)

* Horizontal Rules `<hr />`: t is used to add a break between themes 
![hr](https://th.bing.com/th/id/Re9ec636d976d7368ed34af2966024454?rik=rMTn%2bkgjuMtSaw&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mrinitialman.com%2fLibrary%2fHTML%2fPictures%2fHTML-Empty_and_Semantics%2fhoriz_rule.jpg&ehk=BEczC9FArS55jaDu%2ft526OXIK9oexiwErrii69Ljx84%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)
 
 `<br />` & `<hr />` are **Empty elements** because they do not have any words between an opening and closing tag / both of them have only one tag.Before the 
closing angled bracket it should  be a space and a forward slash character.

`Question #9`:**How do HTML editors views of the page you are creating?**

`Answer`they use two ways:

1. a visual editor:it is the same as word processors.

2. a code view:it shows the codes that you are created by visiual editors. you can manually edit or just enter new code.

`Question #10`:**What are Semantic Markup elements?**

`Answer`
* **Strong `<strong>` & Emphasis `<em>`**:
 we use `<strong>`to indicates that the content has strong importance( the text is displayed as **bold**by the browser). but we use `<em>` to emphasize certain words rather than the rest of the text (the text is displayed as _italic_).

* **Quotations `<blockquote>` & `<q>`**:
`<blockquote>`: we use this element to for **longer quotes** that take up an entire paragraph. on the other hand, we use `<q>` for **shorter quotes** that sit within a paragraph.
