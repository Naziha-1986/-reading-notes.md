`Question #1`: **What is Markup?**

`Answer`: it is add tags to the contents of the page to provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the structure for the page.



`Question #2`:**What is the difference between Structural markup &Semantic markup?**

`Answer` _Structural markup_:it is the elements use to describe both **headings and paragraphs**.

_Semantic markup_: it is **extra information**,for example: quotation.

`Question #3`:**How many Headings Levels are in HTML?**

`Answer` There are six "levels" of headings:

`<h1>` for Primary Heading.

`<h2-h6>` for subheadings.

![headings](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-svceFR8h2i8/W2HUxoO0txI/AAAAAAAABDI/lo3bnmndo7I2SpqcxVh-bIsBhk4yrqh2gCLcBGAs/s1600/html-headings.png)

`Question #4`:**How can you create a paragraph in HTML?**

`Answer` You can create a paragraph by surrounding the words that make up the paragraph with an opening tag `<p>` and closing tag `</p>`.


![p](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R4897450798aa034b2490500c5d99c3c7?rik=prTdJiFaL3AODw&pid=ImgRaw)

`Question #5`:**What is the difference between `<b>` & `<i>`?**


`Answer`

you can make characters appear bold by using `<b>` tag. so you can use it to present a text in a visually different way.
Even more,you can make characters appear _italic_ by using `<i>` tag.


![bold & italic](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R2d85886c23d5b90762e1083ce90a7352?rik=DENx3U5bDqXdSg&riu=http%3a%2f%2fdocs.moodle.org%2f25%2fen%2fimages_en%2f6%2f6f%2fHtml_tags.png&ehk=%2bVnFuF%2fjJ3KhCTvsVFBJ%2flv09tHHJp%2bYAkHcCysYs%2b4%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)

`Question #6`:**When do you use Superscript & Subscrip?**

`Answer`

we use Superscript tag `<sup>` to make the text up, such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts.

![supscript](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R69e44d15c6cbecdb611102a4fff44814?rik=DMv2r5QdkKLHjA&pid=ImgRaw)

![subscript](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4bdKrgPeYd8/hqdefault.jpg)

`Question #7`:**What is white space collapsing?**
	
  `Answer`
  
White spaces are blank sequence of space characters which treated as a single space character in html.
(if there is two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays as one space).This enables you to organize the html code into a much more readable format.

`Question #8`:**What are Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules?**

`Answer`

* Line Breaks `<br />` it is used to add a line break between paragraphs, for example:

![br](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/break-sentence-result.jpg)

* Horizontal Rules `<hr />`: t is used to add a break between themes 
![hr](https://th.bing.com/th/id/Re9ec636d976d7368ed34af2966024454?rik=rMTn%2bkgjuMtSaw&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mrinitialman.com%2fLibrary%2fHTML%2fPictures%2fHTML-Empty_and_Semantics%2fhoriz_rule.jpg&ehk=BEczC9FArS55jaDu%2ft526OXIK9oexiwErrii69Ljx84%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)
 
 `<br />` & `<hr />` are **Empty elements** because they do not have any words between an opening and closing tag / both of them have only one tag.Before the 
closing angled bracket it should  be a space and a forward slash character.

`Question #9`:**How do HTML editors views of the page you are creating?**

`Answer`they use two ways:

1. a visual editor:it is the same as word processors.

2. a code view:it shows the codes that you are created by visiual editors. you can manually edit or just enter new code.

`Question #10`:**What are Semantic Markup elements?**

`Answer`
1. * **Strong `<strong>` & Emphasis `<em>`**:
 we use `<strong>`to indicates that the content has strong importance( the text is displayed as **bold**by the browser). but we use `<em>` to emphasize certain words rather than the rest of the text (the text is displayed as _italic_).

![strong](https://delante.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/strong-tag-1024x181.png)

![emphasis](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/htmlphrasetags-120103221813-phpapp01/95/html-phrase-tags-2-728.jpg?cb=1325629234)

2. * **Quotations `<blockquote>` & `<q>`**:
`<blockquote>`: we use this element to for **longer quotes** that take up an entire paragraph. on the other hand, we use `<q>` for **shorter quotes** that sit within a paragraph.
 
![blockquote](https://static.javatpoint.com/htmlpages/images/html-blockquote-tag2.png)

example of `<q>` tag:

![q](https://i1.wp.com/www.tutorialbrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/HTML-q-tag.png?fit=656%2C52&ssl=1)

3. * **Abbreviations `<abbr>` / Acronyms `<acronym>`**

![Abbreviations](https://th.bing.com/th/id/Rac8525e247569b327213adec6e86243b?rik=UifKISMeuTUwpA&riu=http%3a%2f%2fgrok.lsu.edu%2fimage%2f24319.gif&ehk=YkKfyzpX%2bHKW2sTSV2b05a5pBQcf2xazgTEC8xcumRM%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)


*The Acronyms `<acronym>` tag was used in HTML4 to definean  Acronym*

4. * **Citations `<cite>` & Definitions `<dfn>`**:

  * we use `<cite>` tag when we want to reference a piece of work, such as a book.so the `<cite>` will tell us  where the citation is from.
  * we use `<dfn>` tag when we want to explain a new terms.

5. * **Author Details `<address>`**:
  * it tells contact details for the author of the page.

6. * **Changes to Content `<ins>`& `<del>`& `<s>`:**
   * we use `<ins>` tag to show the content that has been **inserted** into a document.
   * we use `<del>` tag to show the text that has been **deleted** from it.
   * we use `<s>` tag to show that something  is no longer accurate or relevant but it shoudn't be deleted.

## What is CSS:

![css](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/introductiontohtmlcss-part2-120711042239-phpapp02/95/introduction-to-css-2-728.jpg?cb=1341981277)

* CSS makes web pages more attractive.
* to understand how CSS works you should imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.
* you can control the way that each individual box by creating rules>
* CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements.

### A CSS rule contains *two parts*:

    1. a selector: which element the rule applies to.
    2. a declaration: how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled.
    
   ![CSS rule](https://th.bing.com/th/id/Rc728c3e37a1da82b00611b04bfec4a1c?rik=TiLZexmADewhhQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2ffrontend.turing.io%2fassets%2fimages%2fcss-rule.png&ehk=BRpWKNpvSABYrmvNON9lXEixUusSDfBXUsP3dUXq5Zg%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)
   
   #### CSS declarations made up of two parts:  
   
     1. a property: it indicates what aspects of the element you want to change.
     2. a value :it indicates what settings you want to use for the chosen properties.
     
 ![css declaration](https://th.bing.com/th/id/Ree4cac2ce08bd8b1a5800f8aed2b1823?rik=dQGrp2pUtg1MBQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2fcscie12.dce.harvard.edu%2flecture_notes%2f2014%2f20140224%2fimages%2fcss_property_value.png&ehk=A6iaLrMIzc9O1d8SFE5eVrozlIpg2IO9UMYdtrgGmME%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)
 
 
 ### External & Internal CSS:
 
 a. External CSS`<link>` include:
 
    * href (the path to the CSS file)
    * type (the type of document being linked to)
    * rel (s the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to)
 
 ![css](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R1cfc7c32233e05bdf12bca9ba66b9b50?rik=XXtJzIxnM57oUQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2ffitbloggin.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f06%2fFitbloggin-HTML-and-CSS-for-the-Non-Technical-Blogger-9.jpg&ehk=oefvxml0JBsHIZLzliOwGwzQ6ed2lAbevoGtwGwqg6g%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)
 
 b. Internal CSS `<style>`: you put CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a `<style>` element.
 
 ![internal CSS](https://th.bing.com/th/id/Rec5850033013124817713c0f514a9bb4?rik=noCWafiXBRB7Ig&pid=ImgRaw)
 
 ### CSS Selectors:
 **CSS selector allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document**
 
 ![css selectors](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5021f37bec5845b1a1d21346c256d073)
 
 ### How Css Rules Cascade:
 
 1. *Last rule*: if you have identical selectors, the more specific rule will take precedence over anthor. 
 2. *Specificity*:  the more specific rule will take precedence over more general ones.
 
![](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R7848c180e5d0875a29e07758b5696cec?rik=3YE3wv8frsuqtQ&pid=ImgRaw)

 3. *important*: to indicate that it should be considered more important than other rules, you can add `!` important after any property value.
    
 ### CSS inheritance:
 
 * a property should inherit its value from its parent element.
 
  ![iher](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aOScN7hzzBQ/maxresdefault.jpg)
   
 
![parent](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/inheritance2-090726204631-phpapp02-091105065742-phpapp02/95/css-inheritance-9-728.jpg?cb=1257404280)

### Why do we use External Style Sheets?
-there are  advantages to placing your CSS rules in a separate style sheet:
  * All of your web pages can share the same style sheet by using the `<link>`element.so there is no need to repeat same code in every page.
  * By using CSS stylesheet, the rest of the site will be loaded faster.
  * to make any changes on site appearence you only need to edit the one CSS file and all of your pages will be updated.
   
 ### CSS Versions:

`Question` ?**What is a Variable?**

`Answer` VARIABLE : is a name of storage location of information that needs to do its job. data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs.

![var](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8UmWFTngfwY/XkVRuoPFfkI/AAAAAAAACmI/93j-FMkA9EYyoRIT1qlJ2sMUbobnWT1UgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/javascript_var.png)


`Question` ?**WHAT IS A VARIABLE Declaration?**

* before you use variable, you should announce it by giving it a name *(Variable Declaration)*
* then you should tell variables what type of information you would like to store in it.*(Assign Value/ Variable Initialization)*

## Shorthand for creating variables:
-There are three variations of how to declare variables and assign them values:
 1. Declare Variables  and assign values  in the same statement.
 2. declare more than one variable on the same line, then values assign  value  to each one.
 3. Two variables are declared and assigned values on the same line. 
 
 ## Changing the value of a variable:
 
**when the variable has been created, you do not need to use the var keyword to assign it a new value. You can use the variable name, the equals sign and the new value for 
that attribute.**

## Rules for naming variables:

![name rules](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YTL6exhIGs8/maxresdefault.jpg)

## Arrays:
- It is special type of object /variablem it can it store a list of values.
- when you create the array, you do not need to specify how many values it will hold.
