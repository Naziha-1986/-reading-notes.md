`Question #5`**Why you need to understand how to structure documents?**

 `Answer`  In all kinds of documents, structure is important to make readers  understand the messages you are trying to convey 
and to navigate around the document. So, it will help them to learn how to write web pages.
_For example:The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of 
information (structure word documents). a document might start with a large heading, followed by an introduction or the most important information.

![headings and subheadings](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/textfeaturespowerpoint-140109211555-phpapp01/95/text-features-power-point-10-638.jpg?cb=1389302177)

`Question #6` **What is HTML code?**

`Answer`

![HTMLcode](https://th.bing.com/th/id/Rf324613e5cee25a11f56bf5f8a4d9f7d?rik=hCKEUgm0QLxbEQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2ffreehtmldesigns.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f07%2fHTML-code.jpg&ehk=XfKZVsXXxiFt0JAbKTpuexIi3oTDjsBNO2MUkAC0m84%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)


The HTML code (*in red*) is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets —( called: **HTML elements**).
HTML elements are made up of  **two tags**: an opening tag (<html>) and a closing tag (</html>).these elements tell the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

![opening & closing tags](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.jhj4004RpsfhDHhO1TDPHwHaHa?pid=ImgDet&rs=1)


`Question #7`**What do attributes tell us?**

`Answer` Attributes give us additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are 
made up of **two parts**: a _name_ and a _value_, separated by an equals sign.for example:


![html attribute](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R76ef5eda12c47ac68aa2c07c5739811d?rik=vMtevLVzg8xDhw&pid=ImgRaw)

`Question #8`What is  The Evolution of HTML:

`Answer` Each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last (with new elements and attributes added and older code removed).
There have also been several versions of each browser used to view web pages, each of which implements new code.


![HTML versions](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NIxw5wR_y_0/Wg-j7Dkc3_I/AAAAAAAAAXU/sroCliXoJFgpCiWChWo9cCOEvPCbEHncACLcBGAs/s1600/Html%2Bversions.jpg)


Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using. 

![doctype in HTML5](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R73a8ee5b4e79c7ffd89d44e3c57fdef9?rik=D1TeZJYL0agjdA&riu=http%3a%2f%2f3.bp.blogspot.com%2f-AthYZg1Ha8A%2fT6LFF6156LI%2fAAAAAAAAAX0%2fZhyxOP4Tgw0%2fs1600%2fHTML5-Doctype.gif&ehk=yaiO%2f%2bDOww3Wy6eyMM6wlbVA88%2fpkW2vY5TN5dAdYKc%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)


`Question #9` **How can you make a comment in HTML?**

`Answer` You can add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser and add the text between these characters by using this:

`<!-- comment goes here -->`


`Question #10` **What is the difference between ID & Class attribute?**

`Answer`

* **ID Attribute**is used to  _uniquely identify_ that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a 
number or any other character). **it should be for one element only on the page**.

* **Class Attribute** is used when there is _rather than uniquely identifying one element_ withina document (identify several elements to make them different from the other elements on the page).
**the elements that have the same class attribute share the same value.**

`Question #15` **What are the New Html5 Layout Elements?**

`Answer`
* Headers & footers: header or footer  appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
 `<header>` element used to contain the site name and the main navigation.but The `<footer>` element contains copyright information, along with links to the privacy policy 
and terms and conditions.
* Navigation `<nav>`: it is an element  used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
* Article `<article>`: it is like acontainer for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
* Aside `<aside>`: 
     * if `<aside>` element is inside an `<article>`element, it will contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its 
overall meaning.(for example:pullquote or glossary).
     * if `<aside>` element is outside an `<article>`element ,it will act as a container for content that is related to the entire page.
* Sections `<section>`: it is an element that  groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.     
* Heading Groups `<hgroup>`: it is used to group together a set of one or more `<h1>` through `<h6>` elements so that they are  reated as one single heading.
 
* Figures `<figure>  <figcaption>`: It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images).
* Sectioning elements `<div>`.
* Linking Around Block-Level Elements `<a>`:This allows you to turn an entire block into a link.
(this is not a new element in HTML5, but it was not seen as a correct usage of the `<a>` element in earlier versions of HTML).
 
`Question #16` **What is your primary goal?**

`Answer`  your  primary goal should be focused upon your visitors.It's very important to understand who your target audience is, why they would visit to your site, what type of information they want to find and when they are come back.

 `Question #17`**What is site map?**
 
 `Answer` it is creating a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site.it shows how those pages can be grouped .
 you can use card sorting technique To help you decide what information should go on each page.
A site map will usually begin with the _homepage_. 

![site map](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R1527c639aba98e0eab5008296139b193?rik=GD5Ba5Ji7e1WJQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2fstatic2.creately.com%2fblog%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2016%2f08%2fNew-Personal-Page-Sitemap.png&ehk=cy8sPoGAYjk7vnQaRrQGrz%2f6jHb0PkzSBOYOPEcV0%2f0%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw)

`Question #18` ** What is WireFrame?**

`Answer`  

![wire)frame](https://miro.medium.com/max/1800/0*FVLOt7Tx7P3zPI7T.jpg)

You should not include the color scheme, font choices, backgrounds or images for the website in the wireframe. It should focus on what information needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy to indicate the most important parts of each page.

Visual hierarchy refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see The wireframes make design easy to understand  because you know what kind of information you want to appear on your web page.


 `Question #19 `**How design can be used to effectively communicate the services of a company?**
 
 `Answer`  Most of users skim across entire web pages,they don't read each single word so you can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.
 
 * size: you should use large elements to attract users.so it will be good idea if you use headings in ypur web page.
 * color: when you add color , background and brighter section, you will draw attention to your key messages.
 * Style: you can differentiate similar elements by adding style to one of them.
  
  
 `Question #20` **Why we use Grouping?**
 
 `Answer` Grouping  makes pieces of information related together,so it can make a design easier to comprehend. You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
 
 
 `Question #21` **what is the importance of Good navigation?**
 
 `Answer`Good navigation helps users understand what your site is about and how it is organized.
