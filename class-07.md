## Domain Modeling"
`Question` :what is Domain Modeling?

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem that escribes the various entities , their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.

## object-oriented:
 modelis a method in which An entity stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors

### Tips to follow in  building your own domain models:
1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.

2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.

3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.

4. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.

5. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.

6. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

## Tables `<table>`:
A table represents information in a grid format. 
`<table>`to create a table.
`<tr>` to start of each row.
`<td>` to Each cell of a table.

**Spanning Columns**:
`<th> `or `<td>` element :to stretch across more than one column.
**Spanning Rows**:
`<th>` or `<td>` element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.

## Creating an object:

**Ways to create an object:**
1. LITERAL NOTATION 
2. OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION 

-arrays are a special type of object.

-in JavaScript there are six data types:
five of them are described as simple (or primitive) data types. 
The sixth is the object (and is referred to as a complex data type).
-simple (or primitive) data types: 
1. String .
2. Number .
3. Boolean .
4. Undefined (a variable that has been declared, but no value has been assigned to it yet) .
5. Null (a variable with no value - it may have had one at some point, but no longer has a value)

6. object Under the hood, arrays and functions are considered types of objects.

**GLOBAL OBJECTS: NUMBER OBJECT:**

COMMONLY USED TERMS: 
• An integer is a whole number (not a fraction). 
• A real number is a number that can contain a fractional part. 
• A floating point number is a real number that uses decimals to represent a fraction. The term floating point 
refers to the decimal point. 
• Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers that are too big or too small to be conveniently written in 
decimal form.
