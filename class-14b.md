* In 2012, the company embarked on an initiative — code-named **Project Aristotle** — to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared.

 * Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams. 

* As the researchers studied the groups, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. **First**, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as **‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking**(everyone had spoken roughly the same amount)

* **Second**, the good teams all had high **‘‘average social sensitivity’’** — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.( free-flowing Team)

* **conclusions**: 
1. good managers have always known. In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.

2. Google figure out how to create **psychological safety** faster, better and in more productive ways

3. Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can’t really be optimized.
