### Controlling images size:

-You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box. 

-By default, images are **inline elements**. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a **block-level** element using the display
property with a value of block.

* The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element.

* The path to the image follows the letters url, and it is put inside parentheses and quotes.

**The background-repeat property**
1. repeat-x :The image is repeated horizontally only .
2. repeat-y:The image is repeated vertically only.
3. no-repeat:The image is only shown once.
4. fixed:The background image stays in the same position on the page.
5. scroll
The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.

## Practical Information:

-In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords (the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order to improve its findability.
1. Page Title
2. URL / Web Address
3. Headings
4. Tex
5. Link Text
6. Image Alt Text
7. Page Descriptions

## Video and Audio APIs:
-The `<video>` and `<audio>` elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages.

-One big issue with the native browser controls is that they are different in each browser â€” not very good for cross-browser support! Another big issue is that the native controls in most browsers aren't very keyboard-accessible.

* to solve this issue we use `<controls>` attribute.
